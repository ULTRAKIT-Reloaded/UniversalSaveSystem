# Universal Save System
A persistant data storage system using JSON to store and retrieve data from a file easily and intuitively.
Supports individuals and arrays of types `string`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`.

Can store **global data**, which can be accessed by any mod using the correct key, or **private data**, which is further keyed to the name of the mod calling the functions (or, more specifically, the executing assembly).
